# What is the Power Automate RPA Enterprise Toolkit?

This is a set of tools for teams building automation solutions using **Microsoft Power Platform**. It helps address common requirements of enterprise customers and provides practical guidance for building RPA solutions.

## Manuals link

Please go to https://1drv.ms/u/s!Au_jM7aotZoCn8shSqKwquAKf-GIug for the latest work-in-progress manuals for this toolkit.

## Capabilities

1. Modularity - build reusable components for your bots. Package them and reuse in multiple solutions.
2. Testing - automate the testing process for your modules. Get an overview of test results for all your modules in one application.
3. Work Item Queueing - build real work item queues as opposed to flow-level queues. Work Item queues object groups multiple flow runs for the same input (in case of restarts) and provides common management tools such as retry policies.
4. Flexible tagging for exception handling

## What is ready

* modularity - instructions, templates and sample complete module
* testing - instructions, templates and a sample
* work item queuing - orchestration center app, admin tools

## What needs to be done

* work item queuing - extend documentation to cover ingress and egress, provide a working sample of a complete automated process

## Where to start

Read the PDF manual.

Examine how the **EPA Example** solution is built.

Create your own module using **SampleIntegration**.

Create your RPA solution leveraging the Work Item Queueing capability (manual for this is WIP).
